After using several of the web frameworks that are prevalant in the java world, I do believe I've finally found a virtual nirvana. Here at Mystic, we're doing lots of development with [Wicket](http://wicket.sf.net "Wicket") &#8482;,&nbsp;  a java web application framework that <em>"takes simplicity, separation of concerns and ease of development to a whole new level."</em>

So what does that mean to you and? Web application development without the need for the seemingly unnecessary XML config files that are like plagues in my WEB-INF directories. So if you haven't, download it today .. while the website may not be as fancy as Ruby on Rails, there are some very smart people behind the development of this framework. Another plus, is that there isn't any crazy evangelism happening, similar to what you'd get from DHH or HLS, or .. you ever notice how the most vocal use their 3-letter acronym for name?
