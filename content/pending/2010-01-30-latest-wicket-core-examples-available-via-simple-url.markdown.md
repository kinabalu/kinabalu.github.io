After a recent week long training Mystic gave a week ago, one item that came up was the examples as posted on the official Wicket website are a version behind.  Available here: http://www.wicketstuff.org/wicket13/.

In response to throwing up the latest javadoc at a simple to remember URL on this website, the examples seem to be the next logical step to make available.  So point your browser here:

http://wicketbyexample.com/examples

This is running the latest 1.4.6 release of Apache Wicket.  Enjoy.
