concept is simple:

5 days of Wicket was about:

1. Setting up the Project
2. Writing the Tests
3. Designing the backend
4. Designing the Wicket components
5. Putting it all together

Perhaps something more obvious for React/Redux:

1. Setting up React/Redux environment
2. Writing React components
3. Writing Tests with Mocha and Enzyme
4. Integrating Redux with React
5. Putting it all together

Obviously #4 and #2 are going to be quite large in scope, probably could be broken up into multiple days. We do what we can though. This would be a great series, yuge.
