We've decided to take the plunge and do a quick redesign of the site.  The old one was getting a bit long in the tooth, and we couldn't
see subjecting anybody to that design any longer.  As such, if you see any errors on the site, missing links, big foot, etc, please hit
us up on social media and tell us.  We're using [Jekyll][jekyll] to power the site, and hosted over at [Github Pages][github-pages] to
keep things super simple.  

Look for the old blog posts to be backfilled in here once we figure out how to work the `jekyll-import` tool

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll's GitHub repo][jekyll-gh].
