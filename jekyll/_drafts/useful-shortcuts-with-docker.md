Outline:
- Quick overview of docker commands that are most useful
- Shortcuts on the command line we use most often
- Our build.sh script with build and run targets along with machine names
- Understanding that the way we choose to deploy will change with knowledge
- Alternatives for zsh and bash (zsh is our primary)

Ciao!
