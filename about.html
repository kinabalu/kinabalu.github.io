    name: Andrew Lombardi
    position: Founder &amp; Architect
    desc:
      Andrew Lombardi is a veteran entrepreneur and software developer. His parents taught him to code while barely able to read on an
      Apple // he still wishes he had. He invented the Internet and Nutella (suck it Al Gore) while drinking bulletproof coffee and
      staring off into space. He’s been running the consulting firm Mystic Coders for 18 years, authored a kick-ass book for O'Reilly
      on WebSocket, coding, speaking internationally and offering technical guidance to companies as large as Walmart and companies
      with problems as interesting as helicopter simulation. He firmly believes that the best thing he’s done so far, is being a great
      dad.

    name: Ryan Baer
    position: Full-Stack Engineer
    desc:
      Ryan is a software developer who's been coding since grade school. His interests span a wide variety of topics, including cryptocurrencies, biohacking, and psychology. On any given day you might find him shaking his fist at a website's cruel and unusual password policy, criticizing bad UX design, or coming up with at least 17 ideas for new projects to work on. In his spare time he likes to learn about marketing, do Yoga, and watch Seinfeld re-runs.

    name: John Catalina
    position: Business Advisor
    desc:
      John Catalina has worked in such a wide ranging list of industries and experiences that to write them would equate
      to a big fish story hardly to be believed. As a trusted advisor to Mystic for nearly 10 years, he has helped shape
      the values that we strive for with our customers, and has grounded a sense of purpose into the mission and values
      of the company.
