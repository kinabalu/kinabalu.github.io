Is it possible?  On a whim, I grabbed the top entry in craigslist and found a seller for my buying needs.  It still seems odd to me that Nintendo after 2 years still can't seem to keep any of its consoles nor its popular devices in stock, anywhere.  The mind boggles as to if this is a tactic, but owning one, I see the attraction of ownership.

It ... is ... fun.

None of this feels like work! You gradually work through the games and unlock new ones.  The characters are dorky, for sure, and the dialog on screen prods you to move forward.

I'm actually looking forward to slogging myself onto the Wii Fit tomorrow morning.
