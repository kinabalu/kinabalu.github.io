A flight is sometimes the perfect time for uninterrupted work.  So as we've been building things with the mobile toolkit <a href="http://www.appcelerator.com" target="_blank">Appcelerator Titanium</a>, I ran it from my trusty key shortcut.  Above is the only thing I saw.  I even warn folks about this when giving talks about how to rapidly develop iOS applications with Titanium.\n
How do we bypass this?  <em>Please note, that doing this will disable debugging capability within the Titanium Studio, and possibly won't work past the latest versions</em>.\n
Follow the instructions for your platform to "<a href="https://wiki.appcelerator.org/display/tis/Modifying+Your+Configuration">Find the TitaniumStudio.ini file</a>"\n
<strong>Add the following at the end of the file</strong>\n
<pre>
-Dtitanium.bypassAuthentication=true
</pre>
That's it.  When you run it without an internet connection, development bliss.  Peace and quiet.\n
