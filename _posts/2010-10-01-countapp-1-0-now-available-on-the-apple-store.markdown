<p>It took just over a week for apple to approve it, but we're in.  I decided to learn a little Objective-C in my spare time and built this simple app, it's a counter which you tap to increment.  You can save multiple counters, name them, date them, and it saves your place in between stops and starts, and even power cycles.</p>
<p>Special thanks go to my brother <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.daniellombardi.com">Daniel<&#47;a> for designing the logo, my illustrious beta testing crew which includes my wonderful parents, and all of you who will download the app ... give it great reviews, 5 stars, and send me your ideas for updates.</p>
