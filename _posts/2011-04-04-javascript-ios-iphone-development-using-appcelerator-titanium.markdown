Every time I've visited G&ouml;teborg, Sweden ... I've enjoyed it immensely.  The people here are a lot of fun, and Swedish is great to listen to because it sounds like they're always singing to each other (apparently Norwegian is even more so!).  I used this picture above in one of my slides to discuss the drinking habits of folks just learning Objective-C :)

Here is the presentation: <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/mysticweb-bucket/presentations/sdc2011/Using+Javascript+to+Build+Native+iOS+Applications.pdf" target="_blank">Using Javascript to Build Native iOS Applications</a>

Try out the sample application built during the talk (<a href="http://github.com/kinabalu/SDCSpeakers">SDCSpeakers</a>).  Prerequisites: 

<ol>
<li>Install <a href="http://developer.apple.com/iphone" target="_blank">Apple's iOS SDK</a></li>
<li>Install <a href="http://www.appcelerator.com/products/download/" target="_blank">Appcelerator's Titanium</a></li>
<li>Any version of git :)</li><br />
</ol>
