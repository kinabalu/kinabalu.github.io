    Thank you, thank you! I search for quite a while trying to find the answer to this. In my case I had  blocks sprinkled throughout the page. I all the javascript code into a  function and that did the trick!

    fix was to modify how we were implementing some of our dynamic code to get loaded
    only when the dom was ready.  That script would be put in between script tags
    like normal"

  content: Is this problem related to number of users? We just started experiencing
    this in the past couple of days, with an app that has been in test for several
    weeks, has not changed for several weeks, but one significant change is the number
    of users increased by about 500, and the next day this error started happening
    frequently, and randomly.

    - when URL contains ;jsessionid=... and a result page contains ANY JavaScript
    (even empty)\r\n\r\nIt is somehow linked with \"Show friendly HTTP error messages\"
    in IE6 settings. If this flag is unchecked - the browser shows error, but then
    continues loading page and show it properly. But removing \";jsessonid=...\" from
    URL eliminate the issue.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nGleb"

<p>Just got hit with this error:<br />
<br &#47;><br &#47;><br />
<a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.mysticcoders.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2007&#47;03&#47;Picture%201-1.png"><img src="http:&#47;&#47;www.mysticcoders.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2007&#47;03&#47;Picture%201-1-tm.jpg" border="1" alt="Picture 1-1" hspace="4" vspace="4" width="373" height="100" &#47;><&#47;a><br />
<br &#47;><br &#47;><br />
And regrettably I spent a lot of time searching through Javascript in <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.mootools.net">mootools<&#47;a> javascript, and the small 2 lines of javascript <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.wicketframework.org">Wicket<&#47;a> adds to the page.  Finally, I decided to actually google the error (which I should have done immediately).<br />
<br &#47;><br &#47;><br />
Low and behold, because I was inlining some Javascript for the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.mootools.net">mootools<&#47;a> Tip plugin, Internet Explorer 6 and 7 were upset because I hadn't given them the chance to render the entire HTML yet.  Easy enough to fix, and actually cleans up the code real nice, was to either add it to the body onload, or use javascript.  In my case I used <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.mootools.net">mootools<&#47;a> goodness:<br />
<br &#47;><br &#47;><br />
<em>window.addEvent('domready', Site.start);<br />
<&#47;em><br />
Gotta love Google.  <strike>You can also <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.ryangrant.net&#47;archives&#47;internet-explorer-cannot-open-the-internet-site-operation-aborted-google-map-api">check this site<&#47;a> for some tips on avoiding the problem in the future (especially with GMaps).<&#47;strike><br />
<br &#47;><br &#47;><br />
<strong>UPDATE<&#47;strong> The site above seems to no longer be around, such is life.  I've posted a quick update for several javascript libraries on how to ensure you are executing javascript <a href="&#47;blog&#47;2009&#47;07&#47;11&#47;loading-javascript-on-your-page-properl&#47;">when the DOM is finished loading<&#47;a>.</p>
