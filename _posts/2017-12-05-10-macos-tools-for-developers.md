At Mystic we are always on the lookout for new ways to optimize our workflow and
spend more time doing the things we love. A big motivation is researching and 
identifying the best tools for the job. Here is a list of the 10 apps that we 
find ourselves using on a daily basis. They have become invaluable assets in 
our quest to do better work for our clients daily.

## iTerm


## 1Password

Honorable mention: LastPass, for even though it's been hacked at least 2 or
3 times, they've never exposed sensitive data.

## Docker

## Homebrew

Honorable mentions: Those keyboard jockeys who love using Makefiles and
can waste that amount of time

## Atom

Honorable mentions: MacVim, SublimeText

## Slack

## FirefoxDeveloperEdition
We all know that Google Chrome is the best browser for web development
right? Well, with the release of Quantum, Firefox has jumped in front of Chrome
as the king of experiences for developers, privacy nuts, and everyone else.

## Postman
Sure, you could use curl, or httpie but the amount of functionality in this
app they offer for free, is mindblowing and a true gift to the development
community.

## Launchbar

 (Alfred, Spotlight, Quicksilver)

## Zsh
Choosing a shell is a little bit like your favorite mobile operating system,
or choice of Unix-based editor, or IDE. Nobody will ever agree completely
