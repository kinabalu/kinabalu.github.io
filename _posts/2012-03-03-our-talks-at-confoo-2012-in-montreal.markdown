<p>We were invited up to Montreal, Quebec to present talks on HTML5 and building iOS Applications using Javascript.  The conference was held in quite an amazing city, and the organizers did a fantastic job.  Connected with several new folks, and a few that we go way back with.  </p>
<p>The best part was the scheduling, both of my talks were on the first day, so I could rest easy the latter part of the trip, and offer support and attend "some" talks that I was really interested in.</p>
<p>All-in-all the Montreal people are very warm, even with their city temperature being what I would call freezing.  Wonderful city, wonderful people, great conference, and looking forward to what they come up with next year.</p>
<p>Here are the presentation slides:</p>
