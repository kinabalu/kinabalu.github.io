<p>Last week  I was searching  examples while working in integrating OpenID in a Java Web Applications and I found a very recent article (January 27th) on the IBM developerWorks.<br />
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-openid/index.html"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-openid/index.html">OpenID for Java Web applications, Part 1</a> by J Steven Perry offer a panoramic about OpenID in a modern web applications and uses Apache Wicket as Web framework for the example. The article is really good and offers the whole source code as download.</p>
<p>This article talk about implementing an OpenID consumer Service while the part two will focus on writing an OpenID provider.</p>
