I'm assuming all folks who were project owners received unfortunate news of the imminent shutdown of <a href="http://kenai.com/" target="_blank">Project Kenai</a>.  Apparently after <a href="http://www.oracle.com" target="_blank">Oracle</a> finished acquiring Sun, the Kenai fell under the bus.  It's unfortunate, as it seems like Project Kenai was the only easy way to get access to 3 different repository types, and a bevy of useful bugtracking tools, JIRA among them, those options just aren't available with other systems.

So we're moving the <a href="http://www.mysticpaste.com">Mystic Paste</a> source tree to <a href="http://github.com/kinabalu/mysticpaste">GitHub</a>.  I've also renamed some all of the plugin modules to be in the form <code>plugin-&lt;app name&gt;</code>.  Read more about the Kenai situation on their homepage, it explains in greater detail.

So feel free to check the project out on the GitHub project: <a href="http://github.com/kinabalu/mysticpaste">http://github.com/kinabalu/mysticpaste</a>.
