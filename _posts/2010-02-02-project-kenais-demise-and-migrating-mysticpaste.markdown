<p>I'm assuming all folks who were project owners received unfortunate news of the imminent shutdown of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;kenai.com&#47;" target="_blank">Project Kenai<&#47;a>.  Apparently after <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.oracle.com" target="_blank">Oracle<&#47;a> finished acquiring Sun, the Kenai fell under the bus.  It's unfortunate, as it seems like Project Kenai was the only easy way to get access to 3 different repository types, and a bevy of useful bugtracking tools, JIRA among them, those options just aren't available with other systems.</p>
<p>So we're moving the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.mysticpaste.com">Mystic Paste<&#47;a> source tree to <a href="http:&#47;&#47;github.com&#47;kinabalu&#47;mysticpaste">GitHub<&#47;a>.  I've also renamed some all of the plugin modules to be in the form <code>plugin-<app name><&#47;code>.  Read more about the Kenai situation on their homepage, it explains in greater detail.</p>
<p>So feel free to check the project out on the GitHub project: <a href="http:&#47;&#47;github.com&#47;kinabalu&#47;mysticpaste">http:&#47;&#47;github.com&#47;kinabalu&#47;mysticpaste<&#47;a>.</p>
