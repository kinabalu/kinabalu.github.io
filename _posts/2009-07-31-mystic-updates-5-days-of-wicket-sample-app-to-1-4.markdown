<p>We just finished up a little blog post talking about upgrading the sample app from <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.mysticcoders.com&#47;blog&#47;2009&#47;03&#47;09&#47;5-days-of-wicket&#47;">5 Days of Wicket<&#47;a> to Wicket 1.4 which was just released.  Learn about a simple <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.mysticcoders.com&#47;blog&#47;2009&#47;07&#47;31&#47;after-the-5-days-of-wicket-upgrading-to-wicket-14&#47;">conversion to 1.4 of MysticPaste.com<&#47;a> on <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.mysticcoders.com&#47;blog">Mystic's blog<&#47;a>.  We review some of our findings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generify everything for the most benefit<&#47;li>
<li>Deprecated classes now exist making some of your code obsolete<&#47;li>
<li>Some configuration changes and libraries move around<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul></p>
<p>Overall the process of upgrading took a little under 30 minutes, and for a medium to large code base probably would take a little less than a day from estimates we're hearing.</p>
