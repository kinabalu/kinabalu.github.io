<p>For reasons of sanity, I've decided to integrate the content of WicketByExample.com into the Mystic blog.  This will provide for easier content management, and hopefully provide an avenue for updates.  After talking with a few folks notably <a href="http:&#47;&#47;de.linkedin.com&#47;in&#47;martingrigorov">Martin Grigorov<&#47;a>, I'm particularly excited to see the new stuff coming in <a href="https:&#47;&#47;cwiki.apache.org&#47;WICKET&#47;wicket-60.html">6.0<&#47;a>.</p>
<p>All content, comments, and original authors have been migrated.  You can <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.mysticcoders.com&#47;blog&#47;category&#47;wicket&#47;">view all the Wicket posts on this site<&#47;a>.</p>
