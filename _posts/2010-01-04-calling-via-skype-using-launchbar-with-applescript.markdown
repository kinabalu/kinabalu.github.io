  content: "Hey, great applescripts. These are helping me tremendously. I do have
    one question for you: Do you know of any way to send a command to skype, asking
    \"what is the call that's currently in progress?\" What I want to do is be able
    to hang up the call that I'm currently talking on. The \"active\" of the active
    calls, if that makes sense. Any thoughts?\r\n\r\nThanks."

<p>Being a small business owner, I do a lot of talking on the phone.  It could be on the iPhone, but if I'm at the computer it's usually via <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.skype.com" target="_blank">Skype<&#47;a>.  I like to limit my usage of the mouse to as little as possible, so <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.obdev.at&#47;products&#47;launchbar&#47;index.html" target="_blank">Launchbar<&#47;a> is another absolute must.  Enter Skype Applescripts for Launchbar.</p>
<p>Simply do one of two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select a contact record, and their phone number, <tab>, Call with Skype<&#47;li>
<li>Enter text entry mode ('), type in a phone number with or without country code info, <tab>, Call with Skype<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ol></p>
<p>Long ago, I got the Skype Scripts at the Launchbar forums, but it seems those links are gone now.  And the scripts that I had, for some reason didn't respect the country code and automatically assumed the US country code.  So entering something like +1 and then a number, would send +1+1 and then the number ... obviously Skype didn't think much of this.  Luckily through the power of the internet, I found a macosxhints article which in the comments had a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.macosxhints.com&#47;article.php?story=20050810145110629" target="_blank">perfect replacement<&#47;a> for the "Call with Skype" script.  Here's the original forum posts over at the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;forums.obdev.at&#47;viewtopic.php?f=9&t=1288" target="_blank">Objective Development Forums<&#47;a>.</p>
<p>I've included an archive of the scripts, it should be placed at &#47;Users&#47;<Username>&#47;Library&#47;Application Support&#47;LaunchBar&#47;Actions&#47;Skype.  There are a handful of really awesome scripts aside from the "Call with Skype" including:</p>
<ol>
<li>Answer Skype Call<&#47;li>
<li>Call with Skype<&#47;li>
<li>Decline Skype Call<&#47;li>
<li>Hang Up Skype Call<&#47;li>
<li>Skype Mute Off<&#47;li>
<li>Skype Mute On<&#47;li>
<li>Toggle Skype Mute<&#47;li>
<li>And many many more...<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ol></p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
