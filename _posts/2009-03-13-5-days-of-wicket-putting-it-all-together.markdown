    great deal. I've created my own project following the steps in this tutorial and
    by looking at your github repository.\r\n\r\nEverything builds fine and I get
    no errors when I run mvn tomcat:run and so on, but when I try to submit the PasteForm
    my pasteService object is null. I have verified that I have\r\n\"@SpringBean\r\nPasteService
    pasteService;\". My applicationContext.xml is also the same as the one you've
    made.\r\n\r\nAny help is greatly appreciated."

<p>Here we are, the last day of our <a href="http:&#47;&#47;wicket.apache.org" target="_blank">Apache Wicket<&#47;a> series. &Acirc;&nbsp;While there was only one day that focused on <a href="http:&#47;&#47;wicket.apache.org" target="_blank">Apache Wicket<&#47;a>, we've laid the groundwork needed to get a J2EE project that uses a web framework off the ground. &Acirc;&nbsp;And step-by-step, if you follow along with the team on all 4 days preceding, you will have a greater understanding of how everything is put together, and why.</p>
<p>And as you can see, the actual work that went into the front-end of <em>MysticPaste<&#47;em>, didn't take very long at all. &Acirc;&nbsp;And as good community citizens, we've made the finished product and source code available.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.mysticpaste.com" target="_blank">MysticPaste.com<&#47;a> - our implemented pastebin based on the code examples and tutorials shown throughout this series</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;kenai.com&#47;projects&#47;mystic-apps" target="_blank">MysticPaste Source<&#47;a> - the source code for the pastebin, open source.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.mysticcoders.com&#47;blog&#47;2009&#47;03&#47;09&#47;5-days-of-wicket-day-1&#47;"><strong>On Day 1<&#47;strong><&#47;a>, we learned the many steps it takes to put together a project that can be worked on in a team environment. &Acirc;&nbsp;We've enjoyed your comments on different methodologies, and some we will definitely take into account. &Acirc;&nbsp;The biggest thing to take away from that day, is to understand the underpinnings of why things are where they are in a project, and how adherence to the fairly accepted <a href="http:&#47;&#47;maven.apache.org" target="_blank">Maven<&#47;a> standard structure can make life much much easier.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.mysticcoders.com&#47;blog&#47;2009&#47;03&#47;10&#47;5-days-of-wicket-writing-the-tests&#47;"><strong>On Day 2<&#47;strong><&#47;a>, we ran through some basics on Mocks, and with a bit of upfront design on interfaces, a testing harness is available for building out the backend. &Acirc;&nbsp;We also learned how to take <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.unitils.org&#47;" target="_blank">Unitils<&#47;a> and extend our tests passed just a functional unit, and move through many layers of the built system, and ensure we go a bit beyond just code coverage.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.mysticcoders.com&#47;blog&#47;2009&#47;03&#47;11&#47;5-days-of-wicket-day-designing-the-backend&#47;" target="_blank"><strong>On Day 3<&#47;strong><&#47;a>, with unit tests in place, we felt safe writing some implementations so we moved the codebase from failing tests due to no implementation, to working tests. &Acirc;&nbsp;We learned a bit about designing your domain model based on requirements and design discussions, and molding the service and persistence layer to support your business goals.</p>
<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.mysticcoders.com&#47;blog&#47;2009&#47;03&#47;12&#47;5-days-of-wicket-the-ui&#47;"><strong>On Day 4<&#47;strong><&#47;a>, we got to the most exciting part of our journey, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;wicket.apache.org" target="_blank">Apache Wicket<&#47;a>. &Acirc;&nbsp;The article walked you through some of the basics of putting a page together using markup inheritance, and amazingly enough, how this simple act removes the need for technology so common in the MVC world to support this. &Acirc;&nbsp;Best of all, because its all in Java, ultimately you can actually use your IDE and refactor or debug as needed. &Acirc;&nbsp;Each of the most basic components with forms, and display, and the wicket-based tags that act as extensions to your HTML pages, were reviewed with links off to the Javadoc for further discovery. &Acirc;&nbsp;One of the many reasons to love Wicket, is the clear separation of functional concerns, no code in your template pages, it's just HTML.</p>
<p>If you're like the members of the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.mysticcoders.com">Mystic<&#47;a> team, you will CRAVE more. &Acirc;&nbsp;More information, more discovery into how we can fully integrate <a href="http:&#47;&#47;wicket.apache.org" target="_blank">Apache Wicket<&#47;a> as a tool in our arsenal. &Acirc;&nbsp;Aside from downloading the distribution and following along with our tutorial, here are some options ahead:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>TSSJS &#47; LV<&#47;strong> - <a href="http:&#47;&#47;javasymposium.techtarget.com&#47;html&#47;frameworks.html#ALombardiWicket" target="_blank">Architecting Applications using Apache Wicket<&#47;a> - A talk at the symposium by Andrew Lombardi about Apache Wicket.<&#47;li>
<li><strong>Apache Wicket Training<&#47;strong> - Mystic is available for corporate trainings, and is in process of putting together a schedule for different technologies to learn about in 2009. &Acirc;&nbsp;If you'd like to have us come to your business, have your manager contact us at: <a href="mailto:tr&#97;&#105;&#110;&#105;&#110;&#103;s&#64;m&#121;&#115;&#116;&#105;&#99;&#99;&#111;&#100;&#101;&#114;&#115;&#46;co&#109;">&#116;&#114;&#97;&#105;n&#105;&#110;&#103;&#115;&#64;&#109;&#121;&#115;&#116;&#105;c&#99;&#111;d&#101;rs&#46;&#99;&#111;m<&#47;a><br />
<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ol></p>
<h3>What's next?<&#47;h3><br />
With the concepts in these articles, we've laid the groundwork for many more short articles on interesting technology in the future. &Acirc;&nbsp;There is definitely a lot of new and interesting items we can add to <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.mysticpaste.com" target="_blank">MysticPaste<&#47;a> without overcomplicating the streamlined interface, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Syntax Highlighting<&#47;li>
<li>Embedding AJAX where it makes sense<&#47;li>
<li>Remote Interface to the API for pasting from IDE's<&#47;li>
<li>IRC-based bot integration<&#47;li>
<li>Thoughts?  What other things would you like to see us cover on the blog?  Drop us a line at: <a href="mailto:&#116;&#97;&#108;&#107;&#64;mys&#116;&#105;cc&#111;&#100;&#101;&#114;&#115;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;">&#116;&#97;l&#107;&#64;&#109;&#121;&#115;&#116;&#105;&#99;c&#111;der&#115;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;<&#47;a><&#47;li><br />
