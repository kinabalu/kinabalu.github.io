Here at <a href="http://www.mysticcoders.com" target="_blank">Mystic</a>, we've been using an install of TWiki 4 for more than 18 months.  We've also started to heavily use more of the features available in the product, and became increasingly frustrated with the apparent lack of community as of late.  We get a lot of support from folks on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat" target="_blank">IRC</a>, and while some questions were answered, it was essentially a one-man show.  The tubes must have been listening, because right about the time I was ready to abandon all hope, I received a twitter follow from <a href="http://twitter.com/Foswiki" target="_blank">@Foswiki</a>.

See the rest of our post over at <a href="http://blog.foswiki.org/2009/05/mystic-development-migrates-to-foswiki/" target="_blank">Foswiki's blog</a>.  Suffice it to say, we're pleased with our choice to migrate as it looks like the development activity, bugfixing, and general stability of the product has broken through a glass ceiling that must have been in place before.
