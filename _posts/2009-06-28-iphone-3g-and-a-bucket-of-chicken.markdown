<p>Being the proud owner of a new iPhone 3GS, I thought it prudent to sell off my old 3G, which Apple replaced for me about two weeks ago.  The activity usually involves a trip to CraigsList or eBay, depending on how I'd like to handle the product and purchase.  Lately, it's been so much easier to deal with local folks, so I opted for Craigslist.  <a id="more"></a><a id="more-993"></a></p>
<p>After a quick 4 pictures, and a description of the particulars, I posted it this morning.  While I was busy being social with the family, more than 20 folks emailed me about the "ad" in a space of 3 hours.  A few phone calls and text messages later, a buyer with her tween child (the expert), showed up at a local Starbucks.  Exchanges of details, doing the sim card shuffle, lots of eye rolling from the tween, and it looked like we had a deal.</p>
<p>And then, "Do you have change for $100?".  No, no I don't.  And neither did Starbucks.  So we went across the parking lot to a fast food chicken joint, to break the $100 bill.  Not to be outdone by Starbucks, they initially refused to change it (understandable), so I told the buyer to get a bucket of chicken.  Finger lickin' good!</p>
<p>Good enough for me.  Next!</p>
