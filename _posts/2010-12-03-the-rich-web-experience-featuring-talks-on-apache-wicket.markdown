<p>That's right folks, we've again taken the love for <a href="http:&#47;&#47;wicket.apache.org" target="_blank">Apache Wicket<&#47;a> on the road to Ft Lauderdale, Florida!  The team that puts on these shows is the same that does the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.nofluffjuststuff.com&#47;" target="_blank">No Fluff Just Stuff<&#47;a> tours around the USA.  This show though, and &Uuml;berconf before it are all about longer more in-depth sessions so you leave knowing how to get started, and workshopping with the speakers and deep diving into actually building with that technology.</p>
<p>We had a great group enthused about Apache Wicket, some trying it for the first time, and others already fans with some laser-guided questions for how to get more out of the framework.  </p>
<p>Here are links as references for the folks who were unable to attend and those who asked them to reposted:</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
