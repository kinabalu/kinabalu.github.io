The trip to Sofia is underway in a week.  On the docket is a Websockets discussion, and one about our favorite mobile device: iOS.  We'll mix some JavaScript, possibly others into the mix as well.  Check out the details and my <a href="http://2013.java2days.com/?p=408">fancy new bio</a> on the <a href="http://2013.java2days.com/">Java2Days website</a>.\n
Time to find all of our cold-weather gear, grab a bottle of Rakia and Nutella, and warm by the fire before the flight.\n
See you in Bulgaria!  ÐÐ° Ð´Ð¾Ð±ÑŠÑ€ Ð¿ÑŠÑ‚!\n
