The trip to Sofia is underway in a week.  On the docket is a Websockets discussion, and one about our favorite mobile device: iOS.  We'll mix some JavaScript, possibly others into the mix as well.  Check out the details and my [fancy new bio][java2days_fancynewbio] on the [Java2Days website][java2days_web].

Time to find all of our cold-weather gear, grab a bottle of Rakia and Nutella, and warm by the fire before the flight.

See you in Bulgaria!  &ETH;¬ù&ETH;&deg; &ETH;&acute;&ETH;&frac34;&ETH;&plusmn;&Ntilde;&Scaron;&Ntilde;&euro; &ETH;&iquest;&Ntilde;&Scaron;&Ntilde;&sbquo;!
