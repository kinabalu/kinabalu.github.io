I'm currently in Europe speaking at <a href="http://scandevconf.se" target="_blank">Scandevconf.SE</a>.  And apparently some spammers have copied legitimate emails that I've sent to mailing lists with a signature line containing company phone numbers, and used this as seed content to pass through the usually pretty good spam filters.

Ordinarily this wouldn't be against the norm for spammer sewer sludge, but since there are contact numbers in there, I've gotten several nasty text message and voicemails which are definitely filled with vile.  And I don't really blame them.

So if you get an email, and it's obviously spam, and it has copies of our signature line on it, IT WASN'T US.  We would never send emails that weren't opt-in quality, and we'd like to string them up as much as you.
