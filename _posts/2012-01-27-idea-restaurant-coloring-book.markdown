<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.mysticcoders.com&#47;idea-lab&#47;"><em>A full list of the ideas currently in the IdeaLab<&#47;em><&#47;a></p>
<p>You're sitting in a restaurant, and hopefully, it's a restaurant that has a coloring book because you've brought one or more of your little rug rats.  The coloring book is engaging enough that they are quiet until mealtime, and even give you a bit of time afterward to enjoy company while engrossed in crayon heaven.</p>
<p>What happens when they're so engrossed in their coloring creation, they won't leave.  Sure, you can take it with you but it's not easy to color in a car without a flat surface.  But it is easy to do those things on an iPad (i.e. the portable kid entertainment device).</p>
<p>As a restaurant, you can differentiate yourself by your food, your service, or that you have awesome coloring &#47; activity books.</p>
<p>The idea: offer restaurants a set of coloring options which parents can access on their iPad, and make it specific to that store location.  </p>
<p>So, a parent would download the "Restaurant Coloring Book" app on their iPad, and access the app while in the restaurant.  The app would notice that they were in that restaurant, and automatically show them cool new coloring book pages exclusively available at that store.  And when they were done with food, parents don't have to find a place for "yet another coloring page that your young child has done" on their wall, and instead can feature it on their Facebook page, or just keep it in the app.  And perhaps the restaurant can ask for kids to submit their coloring finished product when completed, and have a TV that will show slideshows of finished coloring.  Nothing is more enjoyable than seeing your work up on a big screen.</p>
<p>* Restaurant Coloring Book is generic, but personalized based on location<br />
* Artists could have a platform to get their work into new and interesting places<br />
* A finger isn't the same as coloring with a crayon, restaurants can rent the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.studioneat.com&#47;products&#47;cosmonaut">Cosmonaut<&#47;a> which is an iPad stylus that looks a lot like an oversized crayon.<br />
* Sharing aspects could be within the families unit (Facebook, whatever).  Or you can allow the restaurant to feature the colorings upon submission while in restaurant</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
