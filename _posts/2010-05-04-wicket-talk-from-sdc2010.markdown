In mid march I attended <a href="http://scandevconf.se" target="_blank">SDC2010</a> in G&ouml;teborg, Sweden.  The event was very well attended with nearly 700 people and was filled with a wealth of great speakers.  Some of the sessions I enjoyed were <a href="http://ambientideas.com/" target="_blank">Matthew McCullough</a>, <a href="http://www.stevenlist.com/" target="_blank">Steven "Doc" List</a>, <a href="http://www.augusttechgroup.com/" target="_blank">Tim Berglund</a>, and of course <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Beck" target="_blank">Kent Beck</a> ... too many to count.  There definitely seemed to be an "agile" bend with a lot of the content ... those folks sure do like to talk a lot :).

I presented on beginning <a href="http://wicket.apache.org" target="_blank">Apache Wicket</a> development, and here's the presentation:

Enjoy!
