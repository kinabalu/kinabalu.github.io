<p>In mid march I attended <a href="http:&#47;&#47;scandevconf.se" target="_blank">SDC2010<&#47;a> in G&ouml;teborg, Sweden.  The event was very well attended with nearly 700 people and was filled with a wealth of great speakers.  Some of the sessions I enjoyed were <a href="http:&#47;&#47;ambientideas.com&#47;" target="_blank">Matthew McCullough<&#47;a>, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.stevenlist.com&#47;" target="_blank">Steven "Doc" List<&#47;a>, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.augusttechgroup.com&#47;" target="_blank">Tim Berglund<&#47;a>, and of course <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;Kent_Beck" target="_blank">Kent Beck<&#47;a> ... too many to count.  There definitely seemed to be an "agile" bend with a lot of the content ... those folks sure do like to talk a lot :).</p>
<p>I presented on beginning <a href="http:&#47;&#47;wicket.apache.org" target="_blank">Apache Wicket<&#47;a> development, and here's the presentation:</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
