  content: "Red Hammer Software makes \"Meditation\" which is basically a soundboard
    and provides a bunch of variety. Under the name Relaxation Technologies Studio,
    they offer \"Meditation+\". Not sure what the difference is, other than the category
    in the app store. Tesla Audio Sciences offers \"Pure Meditation | AmbiScience
    (tm)\" which is \"Ambient Music and Brain Wave Entrainment to help you meditate
    like a Buddhist!\"\r\n\r\nThey're all $0.99.\r\n\r\nYou know I love you, so I
    have to ask \"So what would make yours be a purple cow?\""

  content: "The interesting thing about these idea posts, is evolution.  This was
    an idea I wrote down probably 4 years ago, and I want to \"crowd source\" it.
    \ These soundboards are interesting apps, but seem to be too generic and expecting
    that you'll know to combine these ten sounds to create 5 minutes of meditative
    goodness.\r\n\r\n* Simpler?\r\n* Structure with teaching - perhaps instead of
    just giving you the tools for meditation, it can provide overviews of how specific
    meditations are done, transcendental, huna, focused attention, zen, etc.\r\n*
    Slideshow - sometimes an open-eyed meditation is particularly powerful with some
    inspiring music behind it of your choosing\r\n* Social - sharing aspect, where
    you can build a five minute meditation, name it, and then share it with your friends
    on Facebook.\r\n\r\nThoughts?"

<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.mysticcoders.com&#47;idea-lab&#47;"><em>A full list of the ideas currently in the IdeaLab<&#47;em><&#47;a></p>
<p>We bring our phones everywhere with us.  And more and more, for a lot of us, the iPad is replacing most conventional uses of a computer, and introducing new usages we weren't aware of years before.  With the advent of Yoga and other eastern teachings becoming mainstream, meditation is certainly a big focus and most don't know how to properly achieve this state.</p>
<p>Enter: Mobile Meditation.</p>
<p>The Idea: Your companion will help you achieve that meditative state.  With a pair of headphones, and many different programs to select from, zen is just a couple of taps away.</p>
<p>The How:</p>
<p>1. Include several (public domain) pieces of soothing music designed to induce trance for easier meditation.<br />
2. A timer at a configurable time to gently bring you out of the meditative state<br />
3. Ability to use your own music from your iTunes library during meditation<br />
4. For larger format screens like the iPad, offer the ability to use a slideshow of chosen images to play during the meditation</p>
<p>Another possibility is for in-app purchases of some famous voices helping you achieve trance.  Deepak Chopra, The Dalai Lama, and many others are certainly possible here.  In addition, this can be useful as a morning ritual to pump you up for the day rather than clear the mind.  The inspirational speech given in the movie "Any Given Sunday" being one example, or anything by Vince Lombardi, Anthony Robbins, etc.</p>
