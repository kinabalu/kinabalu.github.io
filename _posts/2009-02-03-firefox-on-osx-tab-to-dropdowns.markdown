<p>Alas, Firefox on OSX has been really good, and thanks to a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;revision3.com&#47;tekzilla&#47;" title="Tekzilla">TekZilla<&#47;a> podcast, it's even better. A major gripe I've had for quite a while, was Firefox's inability to tab to dropdowns. Apparently, the boys at <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.mozilla.org" title="Mozilla">Mozilla<&#47;a> are pulling the keyboard preferences and applying them to form fields.<br &#47;><&#47;p></p>

<p>As you can see in this screenshot, if you select "All Controls", you can now tab to those pesky dropdowns.<&#47;p></p>
<p>Personally, I think <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.mozilla.org" title="Mozilla">Mozilla<&#47;a> should get a bit smarter about this like Safari does, and if you're in a form ... I don't know ... use some common sense?<&#47;p></p>
