Alas, Firefox on OSX has been really good, and thanks to a <a href="http://revision3.com/tekzilla/" title="Tekzilla">TekZilla</a> podcast, it's even better. A major gripe I've had for quite a while, was Firefox's inability to tab to dropdowns. Apparently, the boys at <a href="http://www.mozilla.org" title="Mozilla">Mozilla</a> are pulling the keyboard preferences and applying them to form fields.

As you can see in this screenshot, if you select "All Controls", you can now tab to those pesky dropdowns.


Personally, I think <a href="http://www.mozilla.org" title="Mozilla">Mozilla</a> should get a bit smarter about this like Safari does, and if you're in a form ... I don't know ... use some common sense?
