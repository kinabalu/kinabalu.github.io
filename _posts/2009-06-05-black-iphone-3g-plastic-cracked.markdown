<p>Early yesterday, just before lunch ... I had one of those technologically sad moments.  My precious iPhone 3G while holding her making a call ... seemed different, especially near the back.  Much to my dismay, what I discovered was a crack that goes from the USB connector up through to the "Designed by Apple" text.  The phone, still worked, so I called AppleCare to find out what the deal was.  After several minutes on the phone, we both figured out that a trip to the Apple Store to visit the support staff was the next best option.</p>
<p>
I went to the local store, there are 4 in a 15 mile radius of the house, flashed my Apple ProCare badge and got seen within 5 minutes by a specialist.  After looking at the phone for a while, and reading his special PDF documents explaining procedure, he said it wasn't covered under the Apple Warranty, and that it was considered "damage".  Damage?  I have never dropped this phone, it has stayed in a case for most of it's waking life, and I'm being told that the hardware warranty doesn't cover a flimsy back on the phone?</p>
<p>
What seems to be of interest here to me, is that the crack probably started from the USB connector and gradually got larger.  I haven't noticed it until recently, because it's always been "in the case".  Another possible troublesome issue, is the phone wouldn't sync a few months ago, so I took it in to Apple, and the associate took a screwdriver and cleaned out the USB portion (could that have done it?).</p>
<p>
I do hope they release a new phone next week, because I really don't feel like shelling out $199 unless I'm getting something "extra" for it.</p>
