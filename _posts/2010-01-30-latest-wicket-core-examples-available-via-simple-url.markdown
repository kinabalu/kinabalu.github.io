<p>After a recent week long training Mystic gave a week ago, one item that came up was the examples as posted on the official Wicket website are a version behind.  Available here: http://www.wicketstuff.org/wicket13/.</p>
<p>In response to throwing up the latest javadoc at a simple to remember URL on this website, the examples seem to be the next logical step to make available.  So point your browser here:</p>
<p>http://wicketbyexample.com/examples</p>
<p>This is running the latest 1.4.6 release of Apache Wicket.  Enjoy.</p>
