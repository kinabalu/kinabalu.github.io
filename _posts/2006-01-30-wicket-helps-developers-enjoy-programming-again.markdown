After using several of the web frameworks that are prevalant in the java world, I do believe I've finally found a virtual nirvana.&Acirc;&nbsp; Here at Mystic, we're doing lots of development with <a title="Wicket" href="http://wicket.sf.net">Wicket</a>,&Acirc;&nbsp;  a java web application framework that <em>"takes simplicity, separation of concerns and ease of development to a whole new level."</em>

So what does that mean to you and I?&Acirc;&nbsp; Web application development without the need for the seemingly unnecessary XML config files that are like plagues in my WEB-INF directories.&Acirc;&nbsp; So if you haven't, download it today .. while the website may not be as fancy as Ruby on Rails, there are some very smart people behind the development of this framework.&Acirc;&nbsp; Another plus, is that there isn't any crazy evangelism happening, similar to what you'd get from DHH or HLS, or .. you ever notice how the most vocal use their 3-letter acronym for name?
