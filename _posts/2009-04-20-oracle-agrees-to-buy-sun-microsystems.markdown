<p>Here at <a href="http://www.mysticcoders.com" title="mystic">Mystic</a> we're invested in what the <a href="http://java.sun.com" title="Java Platform" target="_blank">Java</a> platform has to offer for our clients, and our developers. Since the IBM talks with Sun on purchasing, the community was in heated debates over what this would mean for the Java platform.</p>
<p>As of this morning, unless stockholders and regulatory agencies veto anything, by this summer there will be a new organization to own the Java assets. Information is still being trickled out, but a certain part of it is sad, since Sun has been father to the Java kid for 15 years, and we don't know how <a href="http://www.oracle.com/" title="Oracle" target="_blank">Oracle</a> will foster the next releases of the platform. Oracle has a lot of software built using the Java platform, so let's hope that means they will have a hand in keeping things moving forward, and open.</p>
