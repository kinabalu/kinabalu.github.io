<p><a href="http:&#47;&#47;mysticpaste.com"><img src="http:&#47;&#47;www.mysticcoders.com&#47;wp-content&#47;uploads&#47;2011&#47;01&#47;mysticpaste2_0.png" border="0" &#47;><&#47;a></p>
<p>So our little <a href="http:&#47;&#47;mysticpaste.com" target="_blank">pastebin<&#47;a> has been growing up lately!  After playing the staring role in <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.mysticcoders.com&#47;blog&#47;2009&#47;03&#47;09&#47;5-days-of-wicket&#47;">5 days of Wicket<&#47;a> as an example project, it's been used as a public pastebin for almost two years.  So as with all older stars, it was in dire need of a facelift.</p>
<p>You can click through to the picture above to see the new pastebin.  Here is a quick list of some of the additions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implemented paste replies with automatic diff view + original<&#47;li>
<li>Original pastes will show all paste replies, and all paste replies have a link back to their original<&#47;li>
<li>Massive user interface clean up<&#47;li>
<li>Integrated SyntaxHighlighter 3.0<&#47;li>
<li>Implemented raw text view and download paste<&#47;li>
<li><a href="http:&#47;&#47;gradle.org" target="_blank">Gradle<&#47;a>-based build file (early testing)<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul></p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
