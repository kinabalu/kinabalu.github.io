<p>I've been reading a copy of <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.packtpub.com&#47;apache-wicket-cookbook&#47;book">Apache Wicket Cookbook<&#47;a> by Igor Vaynberg and will be posting a review soon.  Igor is one of the fantastic core developers for <a href="http:&#47;&#47;wicket.apache.org" target="_blank">Apache Wicket<&#47;a> and seems to have an amazing ability to crank out awesome code, and answer questions on the very active mailing list.  Apparently, he might be super human, and wrote a book in his "spare time".</p>
<p>Hats off to Igor, an amazing accomplishment.  Watch this space for a review.</p>
