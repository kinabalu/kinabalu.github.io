  content: "Jared, yes, definitely check back in the next few days, Day 4 should shed
    a lot of light on things if you have questions.  \r\n\r\nAnd if there is ever
    anything you'd like us to cover on the blog, drop me a line.\r\n\r\nCheers!"

  content: "Nice article! A good place for anyone to start off with spring, maven,
    wicket and testing.\r\n\r\nAlthough, I believe an experienced team (3-4 people
    with some 5+ years of java/web experience) would pull those five days off
    in approximately one day! :-)"

  content: "Thanks for the comment!  \r\n\r\nAnd while we certainly could have pulled
    this into a single day of posts, it feels nicer to spread these out, let people
    try everything out, and integrate what they've learned.\r\n\r\nFor more in depth
    study, we also offer trainings, email us at: <a href=\"mailto:tr&#97;&#105;&#110;&#105;&#110;&#103;s&#64;m&#121;&#115;&#116;&#105;&#99;&#99;&#111;&#100;&#101;&#114;&#115;&#46;co&#109;\"

    files?  I have downloaded Spring and checked the dist/ directory but I do
    not see the jar files.  I also cannot get them to download from the repository...
