<p><a title="AeroSimulators" href="http:&#47;&#47;aerosimulators.com" target="_blank">AeroSimulators<&#47;a> had a booth in this years <a title="Heli-Expo 2009 - It Happens Here" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.heliexpo.com&#47;" target="_blank">Heli-Expo 2009<&#47;a> and was showing off the mobile simulator and other simulation products. <a title="mystic coders - to our success!" href="http:&#47;&#47;mysticcoders.com&#47;">Mystic<&#47;a> has been working closely with <a title="AeroSimulators" href="http:&#47;&#47;aerosimulators.com" target="_blank">AeroSimulators<&#47;a> for the past 9 months on some very cool stuff. While we were there, I took the liberty of a few photos of the booth and the giant helicopters in the <a title="Anaheim Convention Center" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.anaheimconventioncenter.com&#47;" target="_blank">Anaheim Convention Center<&#47;a>.<&#47;p></p>
