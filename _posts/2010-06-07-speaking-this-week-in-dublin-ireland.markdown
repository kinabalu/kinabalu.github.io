I've been here in Dublin for a few days now, getting into various forms of mischief and driving all over the joint on the opposite end.  Of course the reason for the visit was to give a few talks on <a href="http://wicket.apache.org" target="_blank">Apache Wicket</a> at epicenter 2010.\n
If you're going, please stop by my talks on Thursday and say hello and give us love for Wicket.  If you've been on the fence about attending, visit this fancy page and get it for a bit cheaper.\n
There are a lot of awesome speakers in attendance at this conference, so you must attend.\n
See you when you get here!\n
