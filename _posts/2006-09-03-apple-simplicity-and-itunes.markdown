<p>I'm sure this has already been heavily blogged, but I just noticed a new option in my "speakers" pull down available on the bottom right of iTunes if you have an Airport Express.</p>

<p>So effectively, probably according to bandwidth restrictions, you can have the song playing at your computer in one room, and in any number of external Airport Express locations.&Acirc;&nbsp; You get a popup which displays a checkbox list of the speakers currently being broadcast to, and allows you to select more:</p>

<p>If more software &#47; hardware companies thought through these seemingly insignificant additions, we'd have a life with better built software.&Acirc;&nbsp; Simple is definitely harder, but better in the end.</p>
