<p>The <a href="http:&#47;&#47;wicket.apache.org" target="_blank">Wicket<&#47;a> folks have released the latest incarnation of the framework in <a href="http:&#47;&#47;wicket.apache.org&#47;apache-wicket-14-takes-type-safety-to-the-next-level.html" target="_blank">Apache Wicket 1.4<&#47;a>.  Notable improvements are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generified IModel interface and implementations increasing type safety in your Wicket applications<&#47;li>
<li>Component#getModel() and Component#setModel() have been renamed to getDefaultModel() and setDefaultModel() to better support generified models<&#47;li>
<li>The Spring modules have been merged (wicket-spring-annot is now obsolete, all you need is wicket-spring)<&#47;li>
<li>Many API's have been altered to better work with Java 5's idioms<&#47;li>
<li>Wicket jars are now packaged with metadata that makes them OSGI bundles<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul></p>
<p>What are you waiting for?  <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.apache.org&#47;dyn&#47;closer.cgi&#47;wicket&#47;1.4.0" target="_blank">Go get it!<&#47;a></p>
