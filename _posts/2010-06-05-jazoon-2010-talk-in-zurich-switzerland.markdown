What can I say?  Switzerland treated me awesome for my first visit, and I look forward to returning soon.  The folks running <a href="http://jazoon.com" target="_blank">Jazoon</a> did a bang up job organizing.  First time I ever presented a session inside of a movie theatre!

In Dublin now, getting ready for epicenter 2010 and enjoying my stay.  If you're coming to this next conference, and want to learn more about how <a href="http://wicket.apache.org" target="_blank">Apache Wicket</a> can transform your next experience with a web framework, attend my talks on Thursday.

As promised to several folks here is the presentation given at Jazoon:

Enjoy!
