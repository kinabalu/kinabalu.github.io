Scott Price over at <a href="http://loadstorm.com" target="_blank">LoadStorm</a> interviewed Andrew about his experiences in the software development arena.  A lot of really great questions asked, and thoughtful answers on where we're at as an industry today, and what the road ahead might look like.
