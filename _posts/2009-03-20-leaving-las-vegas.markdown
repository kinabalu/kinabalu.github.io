<p>Thanks again to everyone who made it to Mystic's presentation on Architecting Applications using Apache Wicket.  I enjoyed sharing the information with you, hearing your questions, and offering solutions for them.  If you have follow ups that were thought of later, please contact us.  Here's a link to the presentation for the interested:</p>
