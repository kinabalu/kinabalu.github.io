<p>Since comments were added many months ago, we've been meaning to make them a little more ... pretty.  So last night one of our guys spent a little time creating a custom component to represent a <a href="http:&#47;&#47;gravatar.com" target="_blank">Gravatar<&#47;a>.  If you have a Gravatar go check out <a href="http:&#47;&#47;mysticpaste.com" target="_blank">MysticPaste.com<&#47;a> and play with the functionality.  It's simple, but fun.</p>
<p>if you don't have a Gravatar, <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.gravatar.com&#47;site&#47;signup" target="_blank">Signup for one here<&#47;a>.</p>
<p>If you'd like to see the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;wicket.apache.org" target="_blank">Wicket<&#47;a> code that supports this, check it out on <a href="http:&#47;&#47;wicketbyexample.com&#47;a-gravatar-image-component-for-wicket&#47;">WicketByExample.com<&#47;a>.</p>
